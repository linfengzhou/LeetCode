## 1 Two Sum
- for index: hash table
## 125
- two pointer
# 15 3sum
- sort first
- two pointer within a for loop
  - watch out duplicates:
    - check dups in loop 
    - check dups in while
# 16 3sum-closest
- sort first
- two pointer within a for loop
  - since the output only contain one element
  - no need for check duplicates num
# 18 4sum
- sort first
- two pointer within a double for loop
  - watch out duplicates:
    - check dups in every loop
    - check dups in while

# 283 moves zeros
- O(n)
- swap when right is 0

# 75 sort colors
- solution 1: hash map
- solution 2: two partition array
- solution 3: one partition array(to do)
