# 34 search for a range
- find left bound first then find right bound, merge them
# 35 search insert position
- binary search 
- find the least number larger than target
# 74 search a 2D Matrix
- find row then col
- or take matrix as a array, binary search
- handling corner case!
# 278 find first bad version
- binary search
- simple
# 162 find peak element
- adjacent number compare
- four condition(actually can minimize to three)
# 159 find minimun sorted array
- classic 00XX
# 33 search in rotated array (very important)
- compare to start first(why??)
- left side:
  three conditions(can be down to two)
- right side:
  three conditions (can be down to two)
- visulize it is the best way to solve it
